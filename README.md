# 3D-Game

The engineering thesis project involved the ‚ÄùDesign and implementation of a 3D game in Unreal Engine using additional tools such
as Blender, Quixel Bridge, and Quixel Mixer, including cybersecurity aspects.

Someday there will be a gameplay recording from my game or screenshots here. If needed, I can send them via email.
